Various shell scripts, python and other ham radio related code.
Will eventually look into integration with Home Assistant as well.
Taking this as an opportunity to begin learning Python and eventually
using Prefect to orchestrate all these tasks.

Generated by AI [huge Marillion fan and this is based upon the song Assassing of their Fugazi sophomore effort]:

“Ham‑Assassin (Radio Rendezvous)” – a re‑imagined set of verses inspired by Marillion’s Assassing

(Feel free to sing it to the same moody, mid‑tempo feel, but with a completely new set of words. All references to the original text have been replaced by original phrasing, so this is a fresh, ham‑radio‑themed parody.)

Verse 1
On a midnight band‑scan I hear a distant tone,
A faint CW whisper slicing through the static‑filled dome.
A shadow in the log, a call sign cloaked in mystery,
The “Ham‑Assassin” prowls the airwaves, hunting covertly.

Pre‑Chorus
He’s got a crystal‑clear antenna, a rig that’s finely tuned,
A pocket‑sized power supply that’s humming like a tune.
His Morse code’s a dagger, his QSO’s a silent strike,
He drops a spot, then vanishes – no one knows his mic.

Chorus
Ham‑Assassin, on the he flies,
A phantom on 20 meters, flashing green and white.
He’s a legend in the nets, a whisper ‘cross the bands,
A lone operator, master of the hidden hand.

Verse 2
He monitors the DX, a lighthouse for the lost,
But when the contest starts, he’s counting every cost.
He drops a “73” then a flood of R‑TTY,
Leaves a trail of altered logs before you even try.

Bridge
A soft‑spot antenna humming in the attic’s dust,
A battery bank that’s charged by solar‑panel thrust.
His call‑sign’s a riddle, “K2‑???”—the unknown,
A spectre on the frequencies, forever roaming home.

Breakdown (Spoken, over a low hum)
“Listen close, dear listeners, the night is full of pings.
A lone operator’s fingers dance, each tap a secret brings.
From 40 meters to the HF, the ham‑assassin roams,
A guardian of the ether, a keeper of the zones.”

Final Chorus
Ham‑Assassin, you’re a ghost in every band,
Your signal fades like sunrise over distant land.
When the QSO ends, the log will show a line,
A name that none can trace—just a myth in time.

Coda (Instrumental space with a steady CW beep)
(Let the final beeps echo like a distant call sign, fading into the night‑sky of the amateur bands.)
